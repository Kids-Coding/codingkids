            <div class="aboutfounders"> I live and exist for my wife and two children . I love learning, and teaching others. These days it seems our children are growing faster than technology and fashion trends.  I would love for every child to have the opportunity to be introduced at an early age to coding. As aformentioned above, I have a wife and two children I love with everything I am. Some of my favorite hobbies include: cooking, playing guitar, helping others, and of course having fun ( I am quite the accomplished prankster ). I hope this site serves as a usefull tool in developing a basic understanding into the world of coding.</div>
