		<p>In today’s digital world, coding is a fundamental skill alongside math and reading, but too few kids have the opportunity to learn to program because it is rarely taught in school. Coding Kid’s mission is to create a fun and engaging platform where children not only learn to program, but also have opportunities to be creative using code.</p>
